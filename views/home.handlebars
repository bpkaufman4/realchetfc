        <p class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-8">Real Chet FC was founded in late 2017 after two high school juniors were cut from their school's soccer team. One of the students, Ken Akimoto, recalled playing in an indoor league with a recreational team in the previous year. Left with nothing to do in the Fall, Akimoto founded Real Chet FC by assembling a roster of friends from the same school, including fellow student August Liberty, who had also been cut that year.<br><br>Under the alias "Real Chet FC Academy," paying homage to tennis legend Chet Redstone, Akimoto's newfound team struggled early on in the season, but after recruiting two high-level athletes, including Brazil native Matheus Grimaldi, Real Chet FC began to challenge for the top of the table. Eventually, this team earned it's way into the championship final against a rival team from the same high school. The Academy team unfortunately barely lost out on the trophy, but with this new year, they are looking to reclaim what they were so close to achieving.</p>
